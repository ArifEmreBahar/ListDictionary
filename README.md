# ListDictionary
ListDictionary is a Unity-serializable generic collection combining list order with dictionary-style lookups. It stores keyâ€“value pairs in an editable list, supports add, update, remove, search by key or value, and index-based access. Ideal for Unity editors where serialization of standard dictionaries is limited.
